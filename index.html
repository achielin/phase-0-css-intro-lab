    <h1>How does writing CSS differ from writing HTML</h1>
    <h2>As we write CSS these are the type of questions we might ask ourselves:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Should we layout the text in a single or double column?</li>
        <li>Should we use a different font colour for the header?</li>
        <li>How should the very content appear on a desktop vs. a moile device?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of the above questions deal with aesthetic and function considerations.These are perspectives of the presentational layer CSS.<br>Let's consider the type of questions we might ask ourselves as we write HTML:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does the order of items within a list matter?</li>
        <li>Should we wrap a list of links inside a navigation tag?</li>
        <li>Is this the most important header in the whole HTML Document?</li>
      </ul>

    <p>The last few questions deal with stracture, hierarchy and meaning.These are the perspectives of the content structure(HTML).<br> When we writ CSS we focus on aesthetic and function consideration.When we write HTML we focus on structure,hierarchy and meaning.</p>
